		<p> I am a Business Analyst at <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/in/overview"> McKinsey & Co. </a> in their Mumbai office. I am interested in the application of multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks to core business problems, and the formulation of novel, realisable solutions.</p>
<!--  		I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>), a self-driving car startup in Oxford -->
		<p> In a past life, I used to work on core research problems spanning across theoretical computer science, machine learning and natural language processing.
